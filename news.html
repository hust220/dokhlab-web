			<span>RNA Structure Prediction</span>
			<a href="#">
			In a paper published today in the journal Nature Methods, Dokholyan group in collaboration with Weeks lab demonstrates a simple, cost-effective technique for three-dimensional RNA structure prediction that will help scientists understand the structure-function relationship of RNA molecules that dictate almost every aspect of human cell life.  When cell behavior goes wrong, diseases &ndash; including cancer and metabolic disorders &ndash; can be the result.

			<span>Unicorn extinction revisited</span>
			<a href="#">
			Legend states that Noah excluded unicorns from the ark, thereby making them extinct today. Elizabeth Proctor found new proof that unicorns are not extinct after all, thus giving us a unique opportunity to revisit the legend and verify facts. After a long day's hard work, she spotted a farting unicorn flying across mason farm road on UNC campus.
