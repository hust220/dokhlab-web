April 14, 2012: RNA Structure Prediction
In a paper published today in the journal Nature Methods, Dokholyan group in collaboration with Weeks' lab demonstrates a simple, cost-effective technique for three-dimensional RNA structure prediction that will help scientists understand the structure-function relationship of RNA molecules that dictate almost every aspect of human cell life.  When cell behavior goes wrong, diseases &ndash; including cancer and metabolic disorders &ndash; can be the result.
